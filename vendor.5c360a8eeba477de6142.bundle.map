You can also\n  * listen to its {@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n  * status is re-calculated.\n  * *\n  * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {@link FormArray} dynamically by\n  * calling its {@link FormArray.push} method.\n  * Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n  * *\n */\nvar FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArrayName, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     */\n    function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._validators = validators;\n        this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        this._checkParentType();\n        this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n        if (this.formDirective) {\n            this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n        }\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

You can also add a `name` attribute, but it's optional.\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/reactiveRadioButtons/reactive_radio_button_example.ts region='Reactive'}\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * @stable\n */\nvar RadioControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     * @param {?} _registry\n     * @param {?} _injector\n     */\n    function RadioControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef, _registry, _injector) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._registry = _registry;\n        this._injector = _injector;\n        this.onChange = function () { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        this._control = this._injector.get(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__ng_control__[\"a\" /* NgControl */]);\n        this._checkName();\n        this._registry.add(this._control, this);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this._registry.remove(this); };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this._state = value === this.value;\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'checked', this._state);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this._fn = fn;\n        this.onChange = function () {\n            fn(_this.value);\n            _this._registry.select(_this);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.fireUncheck = function (value) { this.writeValue(value); };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype._checkName = function () {\n        if (this.name && this.formControlName && this.name !== this.formControlName) {\n            this._throwNameError();\n        }\n        if (!this.name && this.formControlName)\n            this.name = this.formControlName;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype._throwNameError = function () {\n        throw new Error(\"\\n      If you define both a name and a formControlName attribute on your radio button, their values\\n      must match.

The context for\n  * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n  * to the current item from the iterable.\n  * *\n  * ### Local Variables\n  * *\n  * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n  * *\n  * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n  * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n  * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n  * *\n  * ### Change Propagation\n  * *\n  * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n  * *\n  * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n  * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n  * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n  * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n  * *\n  * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n  * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n  * controls\n  * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n  * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n  * as user input.\n  * *\n  * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n  * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n  * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n  * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n  * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n  * be avoided if possible.\n  * *\n  * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n  * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n  * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n  * *\n  * ### Syntax\n  * *\n  * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * *\n  * With `<template>` element:\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n  * <li>...</li>\n  * </template>\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n  * example.\n  * *\n */\nvar NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_lang__[\"f\" /* getTypeNameForDebugging */])(value) + \"'.

Like in the former example, you have the\n  * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n  * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n  * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n  * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(this._getOptionId(value), value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

If used\n  * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n  * control.\n  * *\n  * *\n  * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n  * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n  * *\n  * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n  * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n  * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n  * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n  * the domain model in your class as well.\n  * *\n  * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n  * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n  * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n  * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n  * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n  * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n  * *\n  * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n  * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n  * *\n  * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n  * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n  * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n  * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n  * *\n  * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n  * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n  * than the domain model's value on submit.\n  * *\n  * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n  * *\n  * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n  * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n  * *\n  * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n  * *\n  * @stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__model__[\"b\" /* FormControl */]();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"f\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"g\" /* isPropertyUpdated */])(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this);

Unlike {@link FormControlName},\n  * it does not require that your {@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent\n  * {@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {@link FormGroupDirective} that\n  * exists above it.\n  * *\n  * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\n  * {@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in\n  * {@link AbstractControl}.\n  * *\n  * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {@link FormControl},\n  * or you can set it programmatically later using {@link AbstractControl.setValue} or\n  * {@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\n  * *\n  * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n  * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.

This disallows HTML entities used in the\n * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. \"h&#116;tp\" for \"http\".\n * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,\n * e.g. \"foo&lt;bar/baz\".  Our existing escaping functions should not produce\n * that.

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n  * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition\n  * transition}.\n  * *\n  * ### Usage\n  * *\n  * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n  * *\n  * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n  * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n  * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n  * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n  * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n  * form.\n  * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n  * keyframes keyframes}.\n  * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n  * useful when\n  * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n  * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n  * *\n  * ```typescript\n  * // various functions for specifying timing data\n  * animate(500, style(...))\n  * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n  * *\n  * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n  * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * animate(500, keyframes([\n  * style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n  * style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n  * *\n  * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n * @param {?} timing\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var /** @type {?} */ stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__facade_lang__[\"d\" /* isPresent */])(stylesEntry)) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n *  `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n  * animation\n  * DSL language.

You can also add a `name` attribute, but it's optional.\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/reactiveRadioButtons/reactive_radio_button_example.ts region='Reactive'}\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * @stable\n */\nexport var RadioControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     * @param {?} _registry\n     * @param {?} _injector\n     */\n    function RadioControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef, _registry, _injector) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._registry = _registry;\n        this._injector = _injector;\n        this.onChange = function () { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        this._control = this._injector.get(NgControl);\n        this._checkName();\n        this._registry.add(this._control, this);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this._registry.remove(this); };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this._state = value === this.value;\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'checked', this._state);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this._fn = fn;\n        this.onChange = function () {\n            fn(_this.value);\n            _this._registry.select(_this);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.fireUncheck = function (value) { this.writeValue(value); };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype._checkName = function () {\n        if (this.name && this.formControlName && this.name !== this.formControlName) {\n            this._throwNameError();\n        }\n        if (!this.name && this.formControlName)\n            this.name = this.formControlName;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RadioControlValueAccessor.prototype._throwNameError = function () {\n        throw new Error(\"\\n      If you define both a name and a formControlName attribute on your radio button, their values\\n      must match.

The context for\n  * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n  * to the current item from the iterable.\n  * *\n  * ### Local Variables\n  * *\n  * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n  * *\n  * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n  * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n  * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n  * *\n  * ### Change Propagation\n  * *\n  * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n  * *\n  * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n  * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n  * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n  * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n  * *\n  * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n  * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n  * controls\n  * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n  * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n  * as user input.\n  * *\n  * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n  * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n  * RPC is re-run.

These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n  * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * const form = new FormGroup({\n  * password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n  * *\n  * *\n  * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n  * return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n  * ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n  * }\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n */\nexport var FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} controls\n     * @param {?=} validator\n     * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n     */\n    function FormGroup(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     *  Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n      * *\n      * This method does not update value or validity of the control, so for\n      * most cases you'll want to use {@link FormGroup.addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n      * *\n      * It will return false for disabled controls.

You can then access the control using the\n  * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n  * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly.

You can access\n  * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n  * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n  * *\n  * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n  * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n  * than the domain model's value on submit.\n  * *\n  * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n  * *\n  * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n  * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n  * *\n  * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n  * *\n  * @stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

In other words, if a transition is\n  * defined that\n  * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n  * *\n  * ```typescript\n  * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n  * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n  * // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n  * // animation has fully completed itself\n  * state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n  * state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n  * *\n  * // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n  * // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n  * transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n  * *\n  * // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n  * transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n  * *\n  * // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n  * transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n  * *\n  * // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n  * // the page and the destination state is unknown\n  * transition(\"void => *\", [\n  * style({ opacity: 0 }),\n  * animate(500)\n  * ]),\n  * *\n  * // this will capture a state change between any states\n  * transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n  * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n  * *\n  * ```html\n  * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n  * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * #### The final `animate` call\n  * *\n  * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n  * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n  * animation\n  * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n  * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n  * applied state to be presented correctly.\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n  * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n  * transition(\"void => *\", [\n  * style({ opacity: 0 }),\n  * animate(500)\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n  * *\n  * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n  * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n  * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * transition(\":enter\", [\n  * style({ opacity: 0 }),\n  * animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n  * ])\n  * transition(\":leave\", [\n  * animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n  * *\n  * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ animationData = Array.isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) : steps;\n    return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n}\n/**\n *  `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n  * animation\n  * DSL language.
